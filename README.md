This is the Creative Bakery landing page, showcasing baking, built using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for clean and scalable CSS. The project uses the Sass preprocessor for advanced styling with variables, nesting, and mixins. I tried to add all possible effects and styles without losing the similarity with the model.

Technologies, that were used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, CSS Animations, CSS Flex, CSS Grid, CSS Hover effects.
